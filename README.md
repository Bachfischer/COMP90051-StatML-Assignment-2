# StatML-Assignment 2

## Marking:

* Correctness: Faithful implementation of the algorithm as specified in the reference or clarified in the specification with possible updates in the LMS changelog. It is important that your code performs other basic functions such as: raising errors if the input is incorrect, working for any dataset that meets the requirements (i.e. not hard-coded).

* Code structure and style: Efficient code (e.g. making use of vectorised functions, avoiding recalculation of expensive results); self-documenting variable names and/or comments; avoiding inappropriate data structures, duplicated code and illegal package imports.
